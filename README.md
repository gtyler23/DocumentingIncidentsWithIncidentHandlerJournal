<h1>Documenting Incidents with an Incident Handler's Journal</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of activities captured in the incident handler's journal throughout the Google Cybersecurity Professional certificate course. As I progressed through the course, I utilized the incident handlerâ€™s journal to apply both my documentation skills and skills learned towards learning objectives. For example, documenting a cybersecurity incident, analyzing a packet capture file, capturing a packet, and investigating a suspicious file hash.
